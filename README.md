Notes:
index.html background currently white. uncomment msbt.css:12 to see an image BG. plan: take a picture (of our team members) similar to this one to use as BG
project.html will eventually be deleted. Currently serving as a template for all pages except index.html
bottom navbar uses javascript links instead of href to avoid browser’s link checker thingy covering it up
size of page container (#pageContainer) and sidebar (#sidebar) are being initialized with js based on the size of user’s browser window. there’s probably a better way with css?
